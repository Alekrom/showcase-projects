Showcase projects for application at Wunderpen

### Content

The repository contains two projects. 

The first project is the code I have written for my master thesis and contains the code for all experiments I have conducted during this work. 

The second contains code for a project I am working on in my free time. It can be used to control Ws2812b LED strips using an arduino as a controller and an android mobile app.
