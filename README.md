Coding examples of Alexander Kromer
### Content

The repository contains two projects. 

The first project 'MasterThesis' is the code I have written for my master thesis and contains the code for all experiments I have conducted during this work. 

The second project 'LedApplication' contains code for a project I am working on in my free time. It can be used to control Ws2812b LED strips using an arduino as a controller and an android mobile app. The project is still work in progress.
