Bluetooth protocol:

Communication:

1. Communication starts with the mobile app sending an x
2. arduino answers with an x
	- This makes sure arduino is listening (necessary due to led.show() disabling interrupts on arduino)
3. Command is send by app to arduino


Commands:

All commands are terminated with "!"

$ = value	
/c = color, e.g. "r", "b"
	Note: "m" = master

/b = boolean: 0 | 1 

**************************************

color: "cr$g$b$w$"

dim:

dimSpeed = "ds/c$"

dimChecked = "dc/c/b"

dimKeepColors = "dk/b"

strobo:

type: /t: + -> onInterval, - -> offInterval, o -> offset

stroboChecked: "sc/c/b"

stroboValues: sv/c/t$
